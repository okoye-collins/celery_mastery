docker compose up: Starts up the containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file, creating and starting the containers if they don't exist yet.

-d (detached mode): Runs the containers in the background, allowing you to continue using the terminal after the containers start.

--build: Forces a rebuild of the images before starting the containers, even if they already exist. This is helpful if youâ€™ve made changes to your Dockerfile or application code and want to apply them without manually rebuilding the images.
